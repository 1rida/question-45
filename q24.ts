//More Conditional Tests: You don’t have to limit the number of tests you create to 10. If you want to try more
// comparisons, write more tests.
// Have at least one True and one False result for each of the following:
//• Tests for equality and inequality with strings
//• Tests using the lower case function
//• Numerical tests involving equality and inequality, greater than and less than, greater than or equal to, and
// less than or equal to
//• Tests using "and" and "or" operators
//• Test whether an item is in a array
//• Test whether an item is not in a array

//TEST FOR EQUILITY

let fruit = ("apple" === "apple");
console.log(fruit);

//TEST FOR INEQUILITY

let fruits = ("apple" as string !== "mango" as string);
console.log(fruits);

//REST FOR LOWER CASE

let words = "hello";
console.log("hello" === words.toLowerCase());

//NUMERICAL TEST (GREATER THAN)

let value = 10;
console.log(10 > 7);

//NUMERICAL TEST (equality)

let amount = 2500;

//NUMERICAL TEST (inequility)

//NUMERICAL TEST (less THAN)
