//More Conditional Tests: You don’t have to limit the number of tests you create to 10. If you want to try more
// comparisons, write more tests.
// Have at least one True and one False result for each of the following:
//• Tests for equality and inequality with strings
//• Tests using the lower case function
//• Numerical tests involving equality and inequality, greater than and less than, greater than or equal to, and
// less than or equal to
//• Tests using "and" and "or" operators
//• Test whether an item is in a array
//• Test whether an item is not in a array
//TEST FOR EQUILITY
var fruit = ("apple" === "apple");
console.log(fruit);
//TEST FOR INEQUILITY
var fruits = ("apple" !== "mango");
console.log(fruits);
//REST FOR LOWER CASE
var words = "hello";
console.log("hello" === words.toLowerCase());
//NUMERICAL TEST (GREATER THAN)
var value = 10;
console.log(10 > 7);
//NUMERICAL TEST (less THAN)
var value1 = 5;
console.log(5 < 7);
//numericL TEST (GRETHSER THAN EQUAL TO)
var value2 = 25;
console.log(25 >= 15);
//numericL TEST (GRETHSER THAN EQUAL TO)
var value3 = 96;
console.log(42 <= 96);
