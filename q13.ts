//our Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, 
//and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these
// items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

// let transportation : string[] =["corolla" , "cultus" , "mehran" , "BMW"]
// console.log(`i would like to own a ${transportation[0]}`);
// console.log(`i like ${transportation[1]}`);
// console.log(`i wanna purchase ${transportation[2]}`);
// console.log(`i should go in ${transportation[3]}`);
